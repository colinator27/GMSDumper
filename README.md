# GMSDumper
A program which can dump/unpack/extract some parts of a GameMaker: Studio game.

Currently exports the texture pages and strings.

### To use

1. Using 7-Zip or WinRar, open the target game's EXE and locate the "data.win" file. (if it is data.[something else] then rename it to "data.win")
2. Place the data.win file in a folder/directory with this program's EXE file.
3. Making sure that you're in a safe folder with only the EXE and the data.win file, run the program.
4. If successful, a strings.txt file and texture[id].png files should be generated inside of that folder/directory.
5. Press any key to continue?
